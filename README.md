Deep learning has been successfully applied to multiple AI systems at LinkedIn that are related to recommendation and search. One of the important lessons that we have learned during this journey is to provide good deep learning platforms that help our modeling engineers become more efficient and productive. Avro2TF is part of this effort to reduce the complexity of data processing and improving velocity of advanced modeling. In addition to advanced deep learning techniques, LinkedIn has been at the forefront of Machine Learning innovation for years now. We have many different ML approaches that consume large amount of data everyday. Efficiency and accuracy are the most important measurements for these approaches. To effectively support deep learning at LinkedIn, we need to first address the data processing issues. Most of the datasets used by our ML algorithms (e.g., LinkedIn’s large scale personalization engine [Photon-ML](https://github.com/linkedin/photon-ml)) are in Avro format. Each record in a Avro dataset is essentially a sparse vector, and can be easily consumed by most of the modern classifiers. However, the format cannot be directly used by TensorFlow -- the leading deep learning package. The main blocker is that the sparse vector is not in the same format as Tensor. We believe that this is not only a LinkedIn problem, many companies have vast amount of ML data in similar sparse vector format, and Tensor format is still relatively new to many companies. Avro2TF bridges this gap by providing scalable Spark based transformation and extensions mechanism to efficiently convert the data into TF records that can be readily consumed by TensorFlow. With this technology, developers can improve their productivity by focusing on model building rather than data conversion.

## Compatibility Notes

It is recommended to run Avro2TF with [Scala 2.11](https://www.scala-lang.org/download/2.11.0.html) and above.

## Build

### How to build
Avro2TF is built using [Gradle](https://github.com/gradle/gradle). To build Avro2TF, run:

    ./gradlew build

This will automatically run tests, if want to build without running tests, run:

    ./gradlew build -x test

## Usage
Avro2TF reads raw user input data with any format supported by Spark to generate Avro or TFRecord tensorized training data.

Avro2TF exposes to users a JSON or HOCON config to specify the tensors that a modeler wants to use in training.
For each tensor, a user should specify two kinds of information:
1. What existing features are used to construct the tensor.
2. The expected name, dtype, and shape of the tensor.

### Use Avro2TF in a gradle project
1. Specify the repositories hosting Avro2TF job.
```
repositories {
    maven {
        url  "https://dl.bintray.com/linkedin/maven"
    }
}
```
2. Declare Avro2TF dependency
```
dependencies {
    compile 'com.linkedin.avro2tf:avro2tf:0.1.0'
}
```

### Input Data Requirements
We support all data format that Spark can read, including the most popular formats Avro and ORC.
For categorical/sparse features, we require them represented in NTV (name-term-value) format.

The type of a single categorical/sparse feature will have a type of Array[NTV].
We treat Array[NTV] as a special primitive type.
Thus, the supported input primitive types include:
1. long
2. float
3. double
4. String
5. bytes (for multimedia data such as image, audio, and video)
6. boolean
7. Array[NTV]

Arrays of primitive types with any rank are supported.

### Supported Data Types of Output Tensor
In Avro2TF, the supported data types (dtype) of output tensors are: int, long, float, double, string, boolean, bytes.
We also provide a special data type: sparseVector to represent categorical/sparse features.
A sparseVector tensor type has two fields: indices and values.

In the below table, we list the corresponding data types after loading the serialized tensors in Avro2TF to TensorFlow.
In TensorFlow, bytes is represented using tf.string and users can later decode it to images, audios, etc.
The sparseVector type will be converted to tf.SparseTensor.
